# OneBit TUI - Fixes Applied âœ…

## Changes Made Based on Selene Example

### 1. Module Name Format âœ…

Updated `moon.mod.json` to use proper module naming:

- Changed from: `"name": "onebit-tui"`
- Changed to: `"name": "moonbit-community/onebit-tui"`

### 2. Import Paths âœ…

Updated all `moon.pkg.json` files to use full module paths:

```json
{
  "import": [
    "moonbit-community/onebit-tui/core",
    "moonbit-community/onebit-tui/components",
    "moonbit-community/onebit-tui/reactive"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Fixed Mutability Warnings âœ…

- Made fields mutable only when they are actually modified
- Fixed immutable field assignment errors in:
  - `modal.mbt` - content, width, height, border_style
  - `text_input.mbt` - callbacks (on_change, on_submit, etc.)

### 4. Fixed Test Assertions âœ…

- Changed `assert_eq(` to `assert_eq!(` in all test files
- This matches MoonBit's correct assertion syntax

## Current Status

### âœ… What's Working:

- Core package structure is correct
- Module naming follows MoonBit conventions
- Import paths use full module names
- Mutability issues are resolved
- Test syntax is corrected

### ðŸš§ Remaining Issues:

1. **Examples use UI/FFI packages** that have dependencies we haven't fully resolved
2. **Test compilation** shows some package reference errors
3. **Some examples** reference modules that aren't fully integrated

## How to Test

### Run standalone demos (these work):

```bash
moon run examples/standalone_demo.mbt --target native
moon run examples/basic_demo.mbt --target native
```

### Build core packages only:

```bash
cd onebit-tui
moon build --target native --packages core,components,reactive
```

## Next Steps

To fully resolve all issues:

1. Either remove UI/FFI dependencies from examples
2. Or complete the FFI integration
3. Generate .mbti interface files for all packages
4. Update examples to use only working components

The core TUI functionality (components, reactive, buffer system) is now properly structured according to MoonBit conventions!
