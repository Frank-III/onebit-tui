# OneBit-TUI Cleanup Summary

## What We Removed

### 1. Complex Reactive System ❌

- Removed `/src/reactive/` directory entirely
- Removed signals, computed values, effects, and scopes
- Removed all the complex dependency tracking logic
- **Why**: Too complex, buggy, and unnecessary for TUI applications

### 2. Reactive Demos ❌

- Removed reactive_test, reactive_stress_test, reactive_showcase
- Removed console_reactive, swiftui_style demos
- Disabled declarative_counter_demo
- **Why**: These relied on the reactive system we removed

## What We Added

### 1. Simple State Management ✅

- Added `/src/components/state.mbt` with simple State wrapper (optional)
- Added `/src/components/simple_loop.mbt` for basic render loop
- Added `View::empty()` for conditional rendering
- **Why**: Simple, predictable, easy to understand

### 2. Simple Counter Demo ✅

- Created `/src/demo/simple_counter/` as example of new approach
- Shows state management with just Refs
- Demonstrates inline computed values
- **Why**: Shows the new pattern clearly

## The New Approach

### Before (Complex Reactive):

```moonbit
let count = @reactive.signal(0)
let doubled = @reactive.computed(fn() { count.get() * 2 })
@reactive.effect(fn() {
  println("Count changed to \{count.get()}")
})
count.set(1)
@reactive.flush()
```

### After (Simple Refs):

```moonbit
let count = Ref::new(0)
// Just compute inline when needed
let doubled = count.val * 2
// Update and redraw
count.val = 1
request_rerender()
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: No complex tracking, just mutable refs
2. **Performance**: Good enough for TUIs (terminals are slow anyway)
3. **Predictability**: No hidden magic, everything is explicit
4. **Maintainability**: Much easier to understand and debug
5. **MoonBit-native**: Uses built-in Ref type, no custom abstractions

## Build Status

✅ **Project builds successfully** with 95 warnings, 0 errors

## Next Steps

1. Fix Yoga binding warnings (separate issue)
2. Update remaining demos to use new approach
3. Add more examples of the simple pattern
4. Consider performance optimizations if needed

## Philosophy

> "Make it as simple as possible, but not simpler" - Einstein

For terminal UIs, complex reactive systems are overkill. The terminal can only update at ~30-60 FPS, and rebuilding the UI tree is cheap. This approach has proven successful in immediate mode GUIs like Dear ImGui and egui.

The reactive system was an interesting experiment, but ultimately unnecessary complexity for our use case.
