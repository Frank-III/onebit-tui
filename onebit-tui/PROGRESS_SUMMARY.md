# OneBit-TUI Progress Summary

## ✅ Completed Today

### 1. Architecture Documentation

- Fixed MoonBit syntax errors in ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md
- Updated to use proper trait syntax (`pub trait Component`)
- Aligned implementation patterns with MoonBit idioms

### 2. Event System Implementation

- Created new `events/` package with clean event types
- Implemented Event enum with Key, Mouse, and Focus variants
- Added EventHandler trait for flexible event handling
- Proper KeyCode mapping from FFI types

### 3. Component Trait System

- Successfully implemented trait-based component system
- Updated Component trait with three core methods:
  - `render(Self) -> View` - Convert component to renderable view
  - `handle_event(Self, Event) -> Bool` - Handle input events
  - `is_focusable(Self) -> Bool` - Check if component can receive focus
- All widgets now implement the Component trait properly

### 4. Trait Objects Support

- Confirmed MoonBit supports trait objects via `&Trait` syntax
- Successfully used `Array[&Component]` for polymorphic containers
- Demonstrated working polymorphism in demo

### 5. Widget Updates

- Updated all widgets to use new Component trait:
  - ✅ Button - Full event handling (Enter, Space, Mouse clicks)
  - ✅ Text - Display only, no event handling
  - ✅ TextInput - Keyboard input handling
  - ✅ Row/Column - Container composability with trait objects

### 6. Build System

- Zero compilation errors
- All packages properly linked
- Events package integrated into demo

## 🎯 Next Priority Tasks

### Immediate (High Priority)

1. **Focus Management System**
   - Implement focus traversal (Tab/Shift+Tab)
   - Visual focus indicators
   - Focus trap for modals

2. **Complete Event System**
   - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
   - Text editing improvements for TextInput
   - Event bubbling/propagation

3. **List/Select Widget**
   - Item selection with keyboard
   - Scrollable lists
   - Custom item renderers

### Medium Priority

4. **Scrolling with Clipping**
   - Enable scissor rect when upstream provides symbols
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists

5. **Additional Widgets**
   - Progress bar
   - Checkbox/Radio using existing components
   - Modal/Dialog containers

6. **Grid Layout Helper**
   - Simple grid creation from rows/columns
   - Responsive breakpoints

### Future Enhancements

- Animation system (leveraging Timeline from core)
- Accessibility features
- Snapshot testing for rendering
- Performance optimizations

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **Trait Objects Work** - MoonBit's `&Component` enables proper polymorphism
2. **View as Currency** - Components render to Views, Views handle layout
3. **Event System** - Centralized event types with trait-based handlers
4. **Keep DSL Layer** - `components/` provides ergonomic user API

## 🚀 MoonBit-Native Advantages

- **Trait system** enables clean component composition
- **Pattern matching** for elegant event handling
- **Expression-oriented** syntax for concise builders
- **Ref[T]** for simple state management
- **No runtime overhead** from trait objects

## 📝 Code Quality Metrics

- **Build Status**: ✅ Green (0 errors)
- **Warnings**: 12 (mostly unused variables in demos)
- **Test Coverage**: Basic trait system test passing
- **API Surface**: Clean, minimal, composable

## 🔗 Integration Points

- **FFI Layer**: Stable, working with Zig/C renderer
- **Yoga Layout**: Fully integrated via onebit-yoga
- **OpenTUI Upstream**: Maintaining API compatibility

## 📚 Documentation Status

- ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md - Updated with correct syntax
- ROADMAP.md - Comprehensive plan in place
- Component examples - Working demo showcases trait system
- API documentation - TODO: Add docstrings to public APIs

---

**Summary**: The OneBit-TUI project has successfully established a trait-based component system with working trait objects, proper event handling, and clean architecture. The foundation is solid and ready for building out remaining features while maintaining MoonBit-native design principles.

## 🚀 Latest Session Updates

   - Customizable width and label
   - Different character styles for filled/empty

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **widget/ folder** is the primary component implementation location

- Focus on Component trait-based architecture
- Confirmed MoonBit trait objects work with `&Component` syntax

### What's Working Now
- ✅ Component trait with polymorphism
- ✅ Event system with Key, Mouse, Focus events
- ✅ Focus management with Tab navigation
- ✅ List widget with full keyboard support
- ✅ All widgets implementing unified Component trait
- ✅ Zero build errors - clean compilation

### Demo Results
Running the widget showcase demonstrates:
- List navigation and selection working
- Focus manager successfully cycling through components
- Event delegation functioning properly
- All widgets rendering to Views correctly
- Trait objects enabling polymorphic containers


## 📐 Yoga Layout Integration Confirmed

### How OneBit-TUI Uses Yoga

1. **Components → Views**: Widgets render to Views
2. **Views → Yoga**: Layout engine converts Views to Yoga nodes
3. **Yoga Calculation**: Yoga calculates positions and sizes
4. **Rendering**: Uses calculated layout for drawing

### Yoga Properties Working
- ✅ FlexDirection (Row/Column)
- ✅ Flex (grow factor for remaining space)
- ✅ Width/Height (Fixed, Percent, Auto)
- ✅ Padding and Margin
- ✅ Spacing/Gap between children
- ✅ AlignItems and JustifyContent
- ✅ Absolute/Relative positioning

### Demo Results
The Yoga layout demo shows:
- Sidebar with fixed width (25 units)
- Main content with flex:1 (takes remaining 55 units)
- Correct position calculations
- Proper size distribution

### Key Integration Points
- `layout/layout_engine.mbt` - Bridges Views to Yoga
- `onebit-yoga/` - FFI bindings to Yoga C++ library
- All layout math handled by Facebook's battle-tested Yoga engine
