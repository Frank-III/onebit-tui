# Event Loop Status & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ Current Event Loop Features

### Working

1. **Non-blocking Input** - Uses `is_input_available()` to check before reading
2. **Event Dispatch** - Routes events to focused views and global handlers
3. **Yoga Layout Integration** - Calculates layout before rendering
4. **Focus Management** - Tab navigation between focusable components
5. **Frame Rate Limiting** - 60 FPS target with 16ms sleep
6. **Terminal Session** - Proper setup/cleanup with raw mode and mouse support
7. **Resize Detection** - Checks for terminal resize events
8. **Multiple Quit Methods** - Ctrl+C, ESC, or 'q' key

### Event Types Handled

- Keyboard input (all keys)
- Mouse clicks (with hit detection)
- Terminal resize
- Focus/blur events
- Tab navigation

## üîß Event Loop Improvements Made

1. **Non-blocking Input Check** - Prevents blocking on `read_key_byte()`
2. **Frame Rate Control** - Changed from 10ms to 16ms for proper 60 FPS
3. **None Event Handling** - Properly handles when no input is available
4. **'q' for Quit** - Added universal quit key

## üö® Known Issues

1. **Resize Handling** - Terminal dimensions are stored in immutable App fields
   - Need to recreate App or make dimensions mutable
2. **Mouse Movement** - Not tracking mouse movement, only clicks
   - Could enable with `track_movement` parameter

3. **Event Bubbling** - No proper event propagation through widget tree
   - Currently only dispatches to focused widget

4. **Continuous Rendering** - Only renders on `needs_redraw`
   - Good for performance but might miss animations

## üéØ Next Steps Priority

### High Priority

1. **Fix Terminal Resize**

   ```moonbit
   // Make App dimensions mutable or recreate on resize
   pub struct App {
     mut width : Int
     mut height : Int
     // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Proper Focus System**
   - Visual focus indicators (border highlight)
   - Focus trap for modals
   - Better Tab/Shift+Tab navigation

3. **Add Animation Support**
   - Time-based updates
   - Smooth transitions
   - Progress animations

### Medium Priority

4. **Event Bubbling**
   - Parent widgets can handle unhandled events
   - Stop propagation flag

5. **Mouse Movement Tracking**
   - Hover states
   - Drag support

6. **Better Input Handling**
   - Text input with cursor position
   - Copy/paste support
   - Multi-byte character support

### Low Priority

7. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Dirty region tracking
   - Partial redraws
   - Layout caching

8. **Debugging Tools**
   - Event log
   - Layout inspector
   - Performance metrics

## üì± Demo Apps Status

### Working

- **Todo App** - Full CRUD operations, keyboard navigation
- **Event Loop Test** - Simple counter with arrow keys
- **Widget Showcase** - Demonstrates all widgets

### Needs Work

- Input handling in TextInput widget (basic but needs cursor)
- Scrolling in List widget (offset works but no smooth scroll)
- Modal/Dialog implementation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Recommendations

1. **Keep Event Loop Simple** - Current design is clean
2. **Add State Management** - Consider reactive state system later
3. **Widget Event Handlers** - Let widgets define their own handlers
4. **Layout Cache** - Only recalculate Yoga on actual changes

## Code Quality

- ‚úÖ Non-blocking
- ‚úÖ Proper cleanup
- ‚úÖ Frame rate limited
- ‚úÖ Event routing works
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs resize handling fix
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could use better focus visuals

## Conclusion

The event loop is **functional and usable** for building TUI applications. Main improvements needed are:

1. Terminal resize handling
2. Better focus visualization
3. Enhanced text input

The architecture is solid - we can build real apps like the Todo list!
